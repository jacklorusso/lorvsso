# Jack Lo Russo — designer & engineer

**now**

- 💼 Working as software engineer on the [Design Systems team](https://atlassian.design) at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/)
- 🌱 On a journey to learn Swift — partly because I like the idea of my side projects feeling very different to my work
- 📝 Trying to build more writing into my daily practice. I've thrown up some notes at [jacklorusso.com](https://jacklorusso.com/) if you want to poke around
